This is a default card template. All the fields mentioned on the top are required to stay to our app not to fail. Please change the `title` to be **YOUR NAME** and the `institution` to be **YOUR COLLEGE/THE INSTITUTION YOU ARE WORKING WITH**. You can visit [our repo](https://github.com/mindwebs/hacktoberfest_2020_participation_cards) to add your own page and cards.

 
You can provide an image for your card in the page by simply using the `image` property in the header to add your image URL.
See the example below:

![Our Logo Again](https://mindwebs.org/img/logo.png)

Syntax for this is: 

```
![Our Logo Again](https://mindwebs.org/img/logo.png)
```

In case you can't get your pictures online or if you want to upload an image from your device, you can do that too. For that place your image in `/static folder` and mention the `/image_name.ext` in the header above to make the image appear on your card, like this:

![Our Logo Third time](/static/mw.png)



```
![Our Logo Third time](/static/mw.png)
```

You can also provide some social media links of your choice in the `socials` field in the header.

A header with all the fields will look like:
